## Reflections

A reasonably well polished final product. 

### Pair Programming

Overall an enjoyable experience. Scheduling was ultimately the most difficult part. Things to look out for - stay focused on the same part of the code during work, sometimes we drifted apart and simply worked on different parts at the same time. Most benefit was had when we were focused on the same thing.

Small errors and bugs were picked up much faster, and we were able to work through roadblocks without getting stuck too long.

### The Timer

Was inexperienced with date objects and intervals coming in. Final solution leaned a bit too heavily on an online example because of that. A little more time reading documentation
and researching how date objects worked word have lead to a more robust implementation. 

Key takeaway - slightly more planning.
